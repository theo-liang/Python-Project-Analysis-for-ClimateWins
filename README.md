##### Description
###### This project focused on using machine learning to analyze historical weather data from European weather stations, with the goal of improving weather prediction accuracy for ClimateWins. Key tasks included data preparation, exploration, and optimization to refine predictive models. Findings were summarized with visualizations and presented to support ClimateWins' objective of forecasting weather and extreme events more accurately.
